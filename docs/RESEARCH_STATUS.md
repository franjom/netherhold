# Research status

Snapshot of what is known vs unknown. Authoritative long-form:
`DK2_REIMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §3 (full system-by-system table).
Live question list: `docs/research/open-questions.md`.
What is *built* rather than known, against the long-term goals:
`docs/GOAL_ALIGNMENT.md`.

## Solved (usable today)
- Terrain (41 types), rooms (26 types) and the level tile grid: parsed and
  cross-validated; the dig/claim terrain transition graph is data. See
  docs/research/kwd-terrain-rooms.md.
- Creature definitions: all 46 records parsed (stats, flags, job tables,
  attractions, spells, resistances) — cross-validated against Flame. See
  docs/research/kwd-creatures.md and creature-table-dump.md.
- File formats: WAD, KWD/KLD (~90%), KMF, STR, textures, video — via
  OpenKeeper + dk2-tools; record header verified locally (kwd-container.md).
- Game database: DK2 balance data is KWD `VARIABLES`/`CREATURES`/... records,
  shipped standalone in `Data/editor/*.kwd` on the GOG release.
- Structures: Flame's v1.70 map — 868 structs, 10,548 globals, 7,282 fields.
- Level scripting: all 51 trigger action types enumerated.
- Where gold is: DK2 has no player-gold variable, only four per-place limits.
  Gold lives in tiles. See docs/research/rooms-and-gold.md and ADR-0015.
- Where a room may go: the ROOMS record's own placeable-on flags decide, and
  they partition the shipped rooms exactly as the game plays.
- Where mana comes from: owned land plus a flat 30 for a keeper's dungeon heart.
  Three terrain types out of 41 carry a mana gain and they are exactly the
  ownable non-room ones. The ceiling is a flat 200000 for every keeper, and a
  keeper has exactly one heart whose loss is defeat (both observed in the
  original). See docs/research/mana.md.

## Unsolved (research required before implementing)
- Pathfinding (biggest risk), creature moods/anger, combat resolution,
  job-selection priority order, computer-player AI, audio event semantics.
- Where mined gold goes, and what a room does beyond holding gold or not.
- What happens on defeat when a dungeon heart falls (Q40) - the rule is known,
  the consequences are not, and nothing implements it.

## Per-mechanic notes
One file per mechanic in `docs/research/`, tagged
CONFIRMED / STRONGLY INFERRED / HYPOTHESIS / UNKNOWN per AGENTS.md.

## Answerable by playing the game
`docs/research/observation-checklist.md` — the open questions a person in front
of DK2 can settle by looking, as concrete experiments, ranked by what they
unblock, plus the ones playing cannot settle. The two biggest blockers on the
project right now (Q47, the tile-work rates; Q45, room minimum sizes) are both
on it, as is Q50 - how many swings an imp takes before it runs off with a load,
which is one minute of looking and would corroborate Q47 into the bargain.
