## Current state (2026-08-29)

**M3 tile mechanics: complete. M3 as a whole: partial.** M2 and the five
record types M1 needed are done. 127 tests green with and without a DK2
install, clean tree.

Three honest caveats:
- M3's definition of done also asks for an imp doing tasks, a treasury, gold
  reaching a player, and a Unity view. None of those exist. The terrain half is
  what is finished. **Nothing decides who works** — the work queue is filled by
  tests and by scenario files, and every run that does so reports it.
- M1's stated definition of done was "all 18 record types round-trip". Five are
  parsed (VARIABLES, CREATURES, TERRAIN, ROOMS, MAP) plus the WAD and KWD
  containers. The rest (THINGS, TRIGGERS, PLAYERS, OBJECTS, SHOTS, …) are needed
  at M6 and scheduled there.
- The CI workflow is written and every step verified locally on Windows, but it
  has never run on GitHub. The Linux leg is what turns the pinned state hash
  into a real cross-platform claim; until it runs, that claim is untested.

What can be read from the original game:

| Capability | Entry point | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| WAD archives + decompression | `DK2.Data.Wad.WadArchive` | every entry of all 5 archives extracts to declared size |
| KWD/KLD containers | `DK2.Data.Kwd.KwdReader` | 13 editor KWDs + 71 map KWDs + 330 KLDs |
| Global balance table (197 vars) | `DK2.Data.Kwd.KwdVariables` | values spot-checked vs. community docs |
| 46 creature definitions | `DK2.Data.Kwd.KwdCreatures` | ids match Flame; happy-job % sum to 100 |
| 41 terrain + 26 room types | `DK2.Data.Kwd.KwdTerrainRooms` | cross-parser: room→terrain, room→creature |
| Level tile grids | `DK2.Data.Kwd.MapGrid` → `LevelMap` | every tile of every campaign map |
| **All of the above, as one object** | `DK2.Data.GameDatabaseLoader` → `GameDatabase` | loads the real install; every room's terrain resolves |

What the simulation can do:

| Capability | Entry point | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed-tick loop | `DK2.Simulation.GameSimulation.Tick()` | tick advances exactly one |
| Deterministic state hash | `GameSimulation.StateHash()` | identical over 1000 ticks; diverges on seed/input change; one pinned literal |
| Save/load | `DK2.Simulation.WorldSnapshot` | restored run continues identically for 500 ticks |
| World from real map data | `WorldState.FromMap` | every campaign level builds; tile health from `TerrainDef` |
| Headless scenarios | `DK2.Harness` + `scenarios/**.yaml` | runs on a real campaign map; reproducible hash series |
| CI gate | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Linux + Windows, no DK2 install |
| Dig / mine / claim / reinforce / repair / attack / fill in | `DK2.Simulation.TileWorkRules` | rules run against the real install; terrain graph terminates on a whole campaign level |
| Dig markers, first real command | `TileTagSystem` + `TagTilesCommand` | per player; cleared on terrain change |

Extracted data artifacts (the specification the simulation is written against):
`docs/research/game-database-dump.md`, `creature-table-dump.md`,
`terrain-room-dump.md`. The last of these now carries the terrain table's
`maxHealth` column and full flag set (`dk2tools kwd terrain` / `kwd terrainflags`),
which is what M3's rules are built on.

**Next: the rest of M3 — a worker, a treasury, gold that goes somewhere.**

Latest commit: `0039c9a` (M3 tile mechanics). 11 commits total.

## Where the M2 code lives

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/DK2.Core/Hash64.cs` | FNV-1a structural hash. The determinism gate's foundation. |
| `src/DK2.Simulation/GameSimulation.cs` | The loop, `StateHash()`, system registration. |
| `src/DK2.Simulation/WorldState.cs` | `TileState`, `PlayerState`, `FromMap`. All mutable state. |
| `src/DK2.Simulation/ISimulationSystem.cs` | `SimulationContext` — the only things a system may touch. |
| `src/DK2.Simulation/InputFrame.cs` | `PlayerCommand` base and the per-tick input frame. |
| `src/DK2.Simulation/WorldSnapshot.cs` | Binary save/load, RNG position included. |
| `src/DK2.Simulation/SimulationEvents.cs` | Write-only observation. |
| `src/DK2.Data.Model/GameDatabase.cs` | The data/simulation seam. Immutable, no IO. |
| `src/DK2.Data/GameDatabaseLoader.cs` | Builds one from an install; loads campaign maps. |
| `src/DK2.Harness/Scenario.cs`, `ScenarioRunner.cs` | YAML scenarios and the run report. |
| `tests/DK2.Simulation.Tests/TestWorld.cs` | Synthetic database + `ChaosSystem`. Test-only, no DK2 mechanics. |
| `docs/architecture/simulation-loop.md` | Why the gate is built the way it is. |

## Where the M3 code lives

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/DK2.Simulation/TileWork.cs` | `TileWorkKind`, `TileWorkOrder`, and `TileWorkRules` — the rules, pure and static. |
| `src/DK2.Simulation/Systems/TileWorkSystem.cs` | Drains the world's work queue each tick. |
| `src/DK2.Simulation/Systems/TileTagSystem.cs` | Applies dig markers. |
| `src/DK2.Simulation/Commands/TileCommands.cs` | `TagTilesCommand` — the first real player command. |
| `src/DK2.Simulation/SimulationTiming.cs` | **The only** place ticks relate to seconds. Q1 placeholder. |
| `tests/DK2.Simulation.Tests/Dk2TerrainFixture.cs` | DK2's real numbers, transcribed so the rules test in CI. |
| `tests/DK2.Behavior.Tests/TileWorkOnRealDataTests.cs` | The same rules against the real install — keeps the fixture from drifting. |
| `scenarios/tiles/` | Dig/claim on a synthetic map; gold mining on a surveyed campaign map. |
| `docs/research/tile-work.md` | The evidence, the confidence tags, and the three anomalies. |

## Running things

```
dotnet build DK2.slnx
dotnet test  DK2.slnx
DK2_DIR=/nonexistent dotnet test DK2.slnx      # what CI sees: install-gated tests skip
dotnet run --project src/DK2.Harness -- list
dotnet run --project src/DK2.Harness -- run scenarios
```

Harness output lands in `build/scenario-runs/<id>/` (gitignored).

## Immediate next steps (rest of M3)

Steps 1–3 and 6 of the old list are done (tile mechanics, the first real
command, the timing constant, real scenarios). What is left is the part that
needs an actor, and it is where the project's two hardest questions live.

1. **First Imp** — spawn, task selection, movement. This is what fills the
   `TileWorkOrder` queue that `TileWorkSystem` already drains, so the seam is
   ready. It is also where `IPathfinder` gets its honest A* placeholder (plan
   risk R1, Q5) and where job selection (Q2) starts to matter. Expect this to
   be mostly research, unlike the tile rules which were mostly transcription.
2. **Treasury and gold** — the first resource loop. `TileWorkResult` already
   reports gold released and deliberately credits nobody; give it a carrier and
   a destination. `MaxGoldPerTreasuryTile=3000` and
   `MaxGoldPileOutsideTreasury=2000` are extracted and waiting.
3. **Rooms** — `setup.rooms` is parsed by the harness and reported as
   unapplied. `RoomDef` carries cost, size, construction type and terrain id.
4. **Mana from claimed tiles** — `ManaGain`/`MaxManaGain` are on every terrain
   (Claimed Path 1, Claimed Vault 100) and nothing reads them yet.
5. **Unity presentation** — the simulation can now run a dig-and-claim scenario
   headlessly, which was the precondition.

**Before starting step 1, read `docs/research/tile-work.md` §"What does not fit".**
Q20 (DigRockHealth destroys a rock tile in one application) becomes visible the
moment an imp is doing the digging, and it is a data anomaly, not a bug in the
rules. Do not "fix" it by changing the number.

## Decisions already made — do not relitigate

- **MIT licence** (owner decision). Consequence: **no code may be copied from
  OpenKeeper (GPLv3) or Flame (unlicensed)** — facts only, always with
  provenance. See ADR-0003 in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- GLKeeper is MIT, so its code *may* be adapted with attribution — this was done
  once, for the WAD decompressor (`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`).
- Integer/fixed-point for gameplay maths, `float` presentation-only (ADR-0001).
- Simulation assemblies target netstandard2.1 and must never reference Unity;
  enforced by `ArchitectureTests` (ADR-0002).
- `.slnx` solution format, .NET 10 (ADR-0005).
- Determinism gate design — RNG position in the hash, FNV-1a not `GetHashCode`,
  one pinned literal, test-only `ChaosSystem` (ADR-0006).
- Our own save format; DK2 save compatibility is not a goal (ADR-0007).
- YamlDotNet for scenarios, tooling only (ADR-0008).
- Tile transitions are triggered by the *work*, not by the health level
  (ADR-0009). This is not a style choice — the level-triggered reading is
  refuted by the data. See `tile-work.md`.
- Work orders are a FIFO queue on `WorldState`, filled by whoever is working
  (ADR-0010). Order is behaviour: never sort or deduplicate it.
- Ticks relate to seconds in `SimulationTiming` and nowhere else (ADR-0011).
- Reference install: `E:\GogGames\Dungeon Keeper 2` (GOG). Resolved by
  `DK2.Data.Dk2Install`. **`DK2_DIR` is authoritative when set** — if it is set
  and invalid, no fallback is tried, which is how CI runs with no install.
  Tests auto-skip when it resolves to nothing.

---

## Conventions that are easy to violate by accident

- **A balance constant hardcoded in simulation code is a bug** — read it from
  `GameDatabase`. `GameDatabase[VariableTypeId.X]` throws rather than returning
  zero for a missing value, on purpose.
- **Changing simulation state breaks the pinned hash.** That is the design.
  Bump `GameSimulation.HashVersion` and update the literal in
  `DeterminismTests.StateHash_IsStableAcrossBuildsAndMachines` in the same
  commit. Never "fix" it by loosening the assertion.
- **Nothing in the simulation may read an event back.** Events are write-only
  observation; a system that reads one makes the observer part of the observed.
- **New state must be reachable from `WorldState`** or it is invisible to the
  hash and the snapshot — and therefore silently non-deterministic. When you add
  a field, add it to `HashInto` *and* to `WorldSnapshot` (bump its
  `FormatVersion`) in the same commit.
- **A gameplay rule keyed on a terrain id is a rule about the reference
  install, not about DK2.** Ask the terrain's flags. `TileWorkRules` does this
  throughout and `TileWorkOnRealDataTests` checks it still holds against the
  real database.
- **A number that does not match how the original plays is not licence to
  change it.** Reproduce the data, record the discrepancy as an open question,
  and let the scenario output show it (Q20 is the live example).
- Confidence tags are mandatory in docs and code comments:
  **CONFIRMED / STRONGLY INFERRED / HYPOTHESIS / UNKNOWN**.
- Every researched mechanic gets a `docs/research/<name>.md` using the template
  in `DK2_REIMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Appendix B.
- Never commit anything from `original-reference/` or any `.kwd`/`.wad`/`.kmf`
  (gitignored, but check before `git add -A`; a third-party template slipped in
  once and had to be removed in `4cdcd38`).

---

## Environment gotchas (each of these already cost time)

**Bash heredocs and C#.** Writing C# via `cat > file <<'EOF'` has bitten twice
by eating backslashes (`Replace('\\', '/')` → `Replace('\', '/')`), and once by
choking on a file containing backticks. Use the `Write`/`Edit` tools for any C#
containing backslash escapes or backticks; verify with `grep` otherwise.

**`cat > file` with no stdin hangs** the Bash tool until timeout. So does
`python`/`python3` — it is not installed and the Windows Store stub blocks.
Never write a bare `cat >` redirect, and do not reach for python.

**`ctx_batch_execute` sandbox quirks:**
- `for ... do ... done` loops fail to parse (the wrapper prefixes the command
  on one line). Use separate commands or `;`-chained statements.
- `/tmp` does not persist between commands in a batch — each gets a fresh
  workspace. Pipe directly, or `curl -o` and use the file in the *same* command.
- `python3` is not available; `curl`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `perl`, `xxd` are.

**`dotnet build` takes one project, not several.** Pass `DK2.slnx` instead.

**Windows/git:** CRLF warnings on every commit are expected noise.

## Research method that has been working

Cheap-to-expensive, stop as soon as the question is answered:

1. Is the answer just sitting in the KWD data? (Often yes — check first.)
2. ufdada/dk2-tools 010 Editor templates — independent format facts.
3. Flame's `mapping/DKII_EXE_v170.sgmap` — 868 structs, 10,548 globals.
4. OpenKeeper — consult as documentation only (GPLv3).
5. Only then: IDA/Ghidra on DKII.EXE, using Flame's IDA import scripts.

**Validate offsets structurally, never on trust.** The techniques that have
caught real errors so far:
- Record size must equal `contentSize / itemCount` exactly (caught the 40-byte
  WAD entry stride, which the template got wrong at 36).
- Sum the template's field widths and check it reproduces the record size
  (confirmed terrain 552 and rooms 1055 before writing any parser).
- Look for semantic invariants: happy-job chances summing to 100 across all 46
  creatures proved the JobPreference offsets were right.
- Cross-check between independent parsers: room→terrain→creature references all
  resolving is strong evidence all three are correct.
- Sanity-check values against known DK2 behaviour (Vampire 666 damage, Prison
  spawning Skeletons, Hero Lair healing).

## Live research questions

`docs/research/open-questions.md` holds all 23 (one answered). The ones that
gate progress:

- **Q1 — simulation tick rate.** Blocking any timing claim. Flame's `limit_tps`
  patch proves it is fixed; the value is unmeasured. It is one constant,
  `SimulationTiming.TicksPerSecond`, and it must stay that way.
- **Q19 — what the health deltas are *per*.** Tied to Q1. The variables table
  spells out `…PerSecond` / `…Seconds` on its other entries and not on these
  ten, which is the whole of the ambiguity.
- **Q20 — `DigRockHealth` is −5000 against Rock's 165 health.** One application
  destroys it, so digging earth is instantaneous, which is wrong. Every other
  work rate is sane. New at M3 and the first place the data and the original
  visibly disagree. Candidate explanations in `tile-work.md`.
- **Q18 is now answered** (2026-08-29): `maxHealthTypeTerrainId` is the
  destination of whichever upward job the terrain admits. Do not reopen it
  without new evidence.
- **Q5 — pathfinding.** The project's biggest risk (plan §9, R1). Flame names
  `Follow_Path` but has zero named fields for it. Nobody has solved this.
- **Q2 — job selection.** Narrowed: candidates and weights are *data*. The
  remaining unknown is the procedure around them (re-evaluation timing, how
  mood picks which of the three tables applies, handling unavailable jobs).
- **Q7 — creature moods.** Genuinely unsolved; OpenKeeper's system is an empty
  stub after 12 years.
- **New at M2 — system update order.** DK2's own per-tick subsystem ordering is
  UNKNOWN. Ours is explicit and declared at registration. It starts to matter
  around M4; treat it as a research question then, not a convenience choice.

## Corrections carried forward

At the end of the previous session I told the owner that `AGENTS.md` references
a `docs/ai/CLAUDE.md` scoping the assistant to research and analysis, and
suggested it might need updating now that implementation has started. **That was
wrong.** No `CLAUDE.md` exists anywhere in the repository and `AGENTS.md` makes
no such reference. There is nothing to reconcile; do not go looking for it.

`AGENTS.md` itself is the operating instruction, and it does not restrict
implementation.
