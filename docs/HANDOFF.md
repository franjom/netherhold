## Current state (2026-08-30)

**M3 tile mechanics, the first worker, rooms + the treasury, mana, and the gold
carrier: complete. M3 as a whole: partial.** M2 and the five record types M1
needed are done. 245 tests green with and without a DK2 install, clean tree.

Three honest caveats:
- M3's definition of done asked for gold reaching a player and a Unity view.
  **Gold now does**: an imp mines into its own hands and carries the load to a
  treasury or dungeon-heart tile (Q31, ADR-0019). The Unity view does not exist.
  What is still missing from the gold loop is the **floor lump** an imp leaves
  when there is nowhere to unload — it keeps mining, which is what DK2 does, but
  what it cannot hold is lost rather than left on the floor, because a lump is an
  OBJECT (M6). A worker does marked excavation, then claims, then reinforces
  (Q24, ADR-0018); what it does when all three run out is stand still, where DK2
  would have it wander (Q41). **Nothing generates imps** either: scenario files
  and tests place them. Every scenario run that places a worker says all of that
  out loud. And **a room does nothing**: a treasury and a dungeon heart hold gold
  because a variable says how much per tile; every other room is inert terrain
  its owner holds. Mana is income only — **nothing spends it**, because every
  spender is a spell (M7). And **losing a dungeon heart is defeat in DK2 and
  defeat is not implemented**: a keeper whose heart is beaten down here stops
  earning its 30 a second and plays on (Q40, scheduled with objectives at M6).
- M1's stated definition of done was "all 18 record types round-trip". Five are
  parsed (VARIABLES, CREATURES, TERRAIN, ROOMS, MAP) plus the WAD and KWD
  containers. The rest (THINGS, TRIGGERS, PLAYERS, OBJECTS, SHOTS, …) are needed
  at M6 and scheduled there.
- The CI workflow is written and every step verified locally on Windows, but it
  has never run on GitHub. The Linux leg is what turns the pinned state hash
  into a real cross-platform claim; until it runs, that claim is untested.

What can be read from the original game:

| Capability | Entry point | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| WAD archives + decompression | `DK2.Data.Wad.WadArchive` | every entry of all 5 archives extracts to declared size |
| KWD/KLD containers | `DK2.Data.Kwd.KwdReader` | 13 editor KWDs + 71 map KWDs + 330 KLDs |
| Global balance table (197 vars) | `DK2.Data.Kwd.KwdVariables` | values spot-checked vs. community docs |
| 46 creature definitions | `DK2.Data.Kwd.KwdCreatures` | ids match Flame; happy-job % sum to 100 |
| 41 terrain + 26 room types | `DK2.Data.Kwd.KwdTerrainRooms` | cross-parser: room→terrain, room→creature |
| Level tile grids | `DK2.Data.Kwd.MapGrid` → `LevelMap` | every tile of every campaign map |
| **All of the above, as one object** | `DK2.Data.GameDatabaseLoader` → `GameDatabase` | loads the real install; every room's terrain resolves |

What the simulation can do:

| Capability | Entry point | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed-tick loop | `DK2.Simulation.GameSimulation.Tick()` | tick advances exactly one |
| Deterministic state hash | `GameSimulation.StateHash()` | identical over 1000 ticks; diverges on seed/input change; one pinned literal |
| Save/load | `DK2.Simulation.WorldSnapshot` | restored run continues identically for 500 ticks |
| World from real map data | `WorldState.FromMap` | every campaign level builds; tile health from `TerrainDef` |
| Headless scenarios | `DK2.Harness` + `scenarios/**.yaml` | runs on a real campaign map; reproducible hash series |
| CI gate | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Linux + Windows, no DK2 install |
| Dig / mine / claim / reinforce / repair / attack / fill in | `DK2.Simulation.TileWorkRules` | rules run against the real install; terrain graph terminates on a whole campaign level |
| Dig markers, first real command | `TileTagSystem` + `TagTilesCommand` | per player; cleared only when the tile can no longer carry one |
| Workers that excavate, then claim, then reinforce | `ImpTaskSystem` + `CreatureMovementSystem` | the priority order is CONFIRMED (ADR-0018); imps dig a corridor on a synthetic map and on a shipped campaign level, then claim the floor they opened |
| Grid search behind an interface | `DK2.Pathfinding.GridPathfinder` | shortest, wall-respecting, reproducible; reused buffers proven inert |
| Rooms: where one may go, what it costs | `RoomRules` + `BuildRoomCommand` | placement flags partition the shipped rooms; ground rules run on a campaign level |
| Gold, stored in tiles rather than on players | `GoldStore` | per-tile limits honoured; a first treasury is paid for out of the dungeon heart |
| Mana, earned by holding land and a heart | `ManaRules` + `ManaSystem` | the three paying terrains partition the install by exhaustion; income falls when claimed floor becomes a room; a 5x5 heart is worth 30/s, not 750 |
| Gold carried from the seam to the treasury | `CreatureState.GoldHeld` + `ImpTaskSystem` | an imp mines a shipped seam on level 1 and every coin of its 3000 ends in the shipped dungeon heart, 1000 to a tile, across as many trips as its hands need |

Extracted data artifacts (the specification the simulation is written against):
`docs/research/game-database-dump.md`, `creature-table-dump.md`,
`terrain-room-dump.md`. The last of these now carries the terrain table's
`maxHealth` column and full flag set, and the room table's full flag set
(`dk2tools kwd terrain` / `kwd terrainflags` / `kwd terrainmana` / `kwd rooms` /
`kwd roomflags`), which is what M3's rules are built on.

**Next: three known defects with known answers, then the Unity view.** See
"Immediate next steps" — claiming from the tile itself, eight-connected movement
and the crowding cap. The gold carrier, which was first on that list, is done.

How this milestone stands against the twelve long-term goals in `AGENTS.md`, and
which of them have deadlines attached: `docs/GOAL_ALIGNMENT.md`. Re-run that
review at every milestone; the asset-abstraction deadline in it (goal 4 must
land *with* the first Unity view, not after) is the one that would be expensive
to miss.

## Where the M3 code lives

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/DK2.Simulation/TileWork.cs` | `TileWorkKind`, `TileWorkOrder`, and `TileWorkRules` — the rules, pure and static. |

| `tests/DK2.Behavior.Tests/ManaOnRealDataTests.cs` | The mana fixture's drift guard, plus the "only held ground pays" partition by exhaustion. |

| `scenarios/imps/` | Two imps digging a corridor from nothing but a tag command. |
| `docs/research/tile-work.md` | The tile rules: evidence, confidence tags, three anomalies. |

## Running things

```
dotnet build DK2.slnx
dotnet test  DK2.slnx
DK2_DIR=/nonexistent dotnet test DK2.slnx      # what CI sees: install-gated tests skip
dotnet run --project src/DK2.Harness -- list
dotnet run --project src/DK2.Harness -- run scenarios
```

Harness output lands in `build/scenario-runs/<id>/` (gitignored).

## Immediate next steps (rest of M3)

**The order changed on 2026-08-29.** The owner's answers turned four research
questions into ordinary implementation work, and that work now comes before the
Unity view, because every one of them is a behaviour a renderer would display
incorrectly.

**Step 1, the gold carrier (Q31), was done on 2026-08-30** — see ADR-0019,
`docs/research/rooms-and-gold.md` §*The round trip*, and
`scenarios/imps/an_imp_carries_gold_home.yaml`. What it left behind: the floor
lump needs OBJECTS (M6), and Q50 — where an imp decides to stop mining — is a
HYPOTHESIS that one minute in front of the game would settle, and that would
corroborate Q47 if the answer is "two swings".

2. **Claiming from the tile itself (Q44/Q42)** — **a known defect.** An imp jumps
   onto the tile it claims and stays ~500 ms; ours works it from a neighbour.
   The ownership condition moves with it: it is the *claimed tile's neighbour*
   that must belong to the keeper, not the tile the imp stands on. Touches
   `ImpTaskSystem.TryJobBeside` / `IsInWorkingPosition`, which currently have one
   adjacency model for walls and floor alike and need two (Q49).
3. **Eight-connected movement (Q28)** — **a known defect.** Creatures cut
   diagonal corners; `GridPathfinder` is four-connected, so every route it
   produces is an overestimate. Settle Q48 first if possible (what a diagonal
   step costs) — uniform cost makes diagonals a free shortcut, octile 14/10 keeps
   distance honest. ADR-0012 already frames the pathfinder as a replaceable
   placeholder behind `IPathfinder`, which is exactly the seam this uses.
4. **The crowding cap (Q43)** — **a known defect.** Three imps a face, twelve a
   block, and a fourth that cannot reach a free face **goes and finds other
   work** rather than queueing. Needs an imp's intended standing tile to be
   visible to job selection.
5. **Unity presentation** — the simulation runs a dig scenario with moving
   workers and a keeper building a room, headlessly, which was the precondition.
   `CreatureState.PosX/PosY` are fixed point in tile units; a renderer converts,
   the simulation never does. **`docs/GOAL_ALIGNMENT.md` gap 3 applies here and
   is the expensive one to miss: the asset abstraction layer must land in the
   same milestone as the first Unity view, not after it.**
6. **What rooms actually do** — a lair, a hatchery, a library and the rest are
   inert terrain. Each needs its own research note; none can be guessed from the
   ROOMS record, which carries art, size and cost and nothing about behaviour.
   Q45 (minimum size for a room to *function*) is the shape of that answer and
   the owner is investigating it.

**Not on this list, on purpose: Q47, the tile-work rates.** Everything here runs
about twice as fast as the original, and the reading that fits is an application
landing twice a second applying half the tabled delta — self-consistent, because
that delivers the tabled amount per second. It is not implemented because the fit
rests on ranges rather than exact counts, and because it changes *when* a tile
flips rather than how fast it wears down. Get exact hit counts before touching
`SimulationTiming.WorkApplicationPeriodTicks`.

**Before touching worker behaviour, read `docs/research/imp-tasks.md`
§"What is not implemented, and is not guessed at".** The priority order is no
longer among the unknowns — it is CONFIRMED and built (ADR-0018) — and neither is
carrying gold (Q31, ADR-0019). What is still missing is missing on purpose:
wandering (Q41), the crowding cap (Q43), dragging bodies, fleeing, building rooms,
picking up gold somebody else dropped, and the floor lump.

**And before adding to `RoomRules`, read `docs/research/rooms-and-gold.md`
§"What is not implemented, and is not guessed at".** Rooms still have no
behaviour and no selling on purpose. Two of that file's open questions are now
answered and the file has not caught up with either: **a room tile must touch
land the keeper owns (Q33, not enforced — bridges can still start in open
water), and selling refunds 50% of cost per tile (Q34) — a number that is in
neither candidate variable, so the data cannot supply it.** The gold half of that
file *has* caught up: §"The round trip" is current as of ADR-0019.

**And before adding to `ManaRules`, read `docs/research/mana.md` §"What is not
implemented, and is not guessed at".** The mana ceiling is the cautionary tale
worth keeping: the data was *nearly* enough to build a computed per-keeper
ceiling out of `MaxManaGain` and `DungeonHeartMaxManaIncrease`, that reading was
tidier than the truth, and it was wrong. It stayed unimplemented only because it
required one more guess (per heart tile or per heart room?), and the owner then
settled it from the game in two sentences - the ceiling is 200000 from the first
second and never moves, which refutes the growing-ceiling variant as well.
`MaxManaGain` and `DungeonHeartMaxManaIncrease` are read by nothing, have no
candidate explanation left, and **may not be used to justify a mana rule**
(Q37a).

**And `docs/research/tile-work.md` §"What does not fit" still stands, but has
been reframed — read Q47 before Q20.** `DigRockHealth` destroying a rock tile in
one application is still a data anomaly and must not be "fixed" by changing the
number. What is new is that it is now the *only* anomaly: measured against the
original, every rate here runs about twice as fast, and an application landing
twice a second applying half the tabled delta reconciles mining exactly and
claiming approximately. That reading is self-consistent — half the delta twice a
second is the delta per second — so **the balance numbers are per-second and the
granularity is what is wrong.** Not implemented: the fit rests on ranges, and
exact hit counts are needed first. `tile-work.md` itself has not been rewritten
for this; Q47 in `open-questions.md` is the current statement.

## Decisions already made — do not relitigate

- **MIT licence** (owner decision). Consequence: **no code may be copied from
  OpenKeeper (GPLv3) or Flame (unlicensed)** — facts only, always with
  provenance. See ADR-0003 in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- GLKeeper is MIT, so its code *may* be adapted with attribution — this was done
  once, for the WAD decompressor (`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`).
- Integer/fixed-point for gameplay maths, `float` presentation-only (ADR-0001).
- Simulation assemblies target netstandard2.1 and must never reference Unity;
  enforced by `ArchitectureTests` (ADR-0002).
- `.slnx` solution format, .NET 10 (ADR-0005).
- Determinism gate design — RNG position in the hash, FNV-1a not `GetHashCode`,
  one pinned literal, test-only `ChaosSystem` (ADR-0006).
- Our own save format; DK2 save compatibility is not a goal (ADR-0007).
- YamlDotNet for scenarios, tooling only (ADR-0008).
- Tile transitions are triggered by the *work*, not by the health level
  (ADR-0009). This is not a style choice — the level-triggered reading is
  refuted by the data. See `tile-work.md`.
- Work orders are a FIFO queue on `WorldState`, filled by whoever is working
  (ADR-0010). Order is behaviour: never sort or deduplicate it.
- Ticks relate to seconds in `SimulationTiming` and nowhere else (ADR-0011).
- The pathfinder is an admitted placeholder behind `IPathfinder` (ADR-0012).
  Four-connected and uniform-cost by deliberate conservatism, not by belief.
- System order is declared once, in `SimulationSystems.Default()` (ADR-0013).
- Imps take jobs in a strict CONFIRMED order - marked excavation, then claiming,
  then reinforcing (ADR-0018, superseding ADR-0014). Carrying gold is NOT in that
  list: it is the tail of a mining job, not a job an imp chooses.
- **Gold lives in tiles; a player has no gold counter** (ADR-0015). DK2 has no
  player-gold variable — it has four per-place limits. `GoldStore` is the only
  way gold moves.
- **A creature's hands are the fourth place gold can be** (ADR-0019).
  `CreatureState.GoldHeld`, bounded by the creature's own `maxGoldHeld`. A
  keeper's spendable total dips while their imps are walking home, and that is
  correct rather than an artefact. Deposits land in the tile the carrier reached,
  which is why spillover between treasury tiles needs no rule (Q35).
- Where a room may go is read from the room's own placeable-on flags, so nothing
  in the rules knows what a bridge is (ADR-0016).
- A `…PerSecond` rate from the balance table is applied **in whole, once every
  `TicksPerSecond` ticks** (ADR-0017), not smoothed across ticks. That keeps
  totals independent of the unmeasured Q1 constant, which is the point.
- **A keeper has at most one dungeon heart, ever, and losing it is defeat.**
  CONFIRMED by the owner from the original, and the ROOMS record agrees — the
  heart carries no `Buildable` flag. This is why the heart's mana is counted once
  per keeper rather than per heart tile, and it is worth knowing before designing
  anything that would otherwise need to count room instances.
- **The keeper mana ceiling is 200000 from the first second and never moves.**
  CONFIRMED by the owner from the original (Q37, Q37a). Do not reopen it with
  `DungeonHeartMaxManaIncrease` or `MaxManaGain`: they look like ceiling
  contributions, they are not, and a ceiling that never moves cannot have
  contributions at all.
- Reference install: `E:\GogGames\Dungeon Keeper 2` (GOG). Resolved by
  `DK2.Data.Dk2Install`. **`DK2_DIR` is authoritative when set** — if it is set
  and invalid, no fallback is tried, which is how CI runs with no install.
  Tests auto-skip when it resolves to nothing.

---

## Conventions that are easy to violate by accident

- **A balance constant hardcoded in simulation code is a bug** — read it from
  `GameDatabase`. `GameDatabase[VariableTypeId.X]` throws rather than returning
  zero for a missing value, on purpose. Consequence, and it bites every time: a
  system that reads a *new* variable breaks every synthetic database until that
  variable is added to it — `TestWorld.Variables()`,
  `Dk2TerrainFixture.Variables()` and `ScenarioTests.Variables()`. That is the
  design working; add the entry rather than defaulting the lookup.
- **Changing simulation state breaks the pinned hash.** That is the design.
  Bump `GameSimulation.HashVersion` and update the literal in
  `DeterminismTests.StateHash_IsStableAcrossBuildsAndMachines` in the same
  commit. Never "fix" it by loosening the assertion.
- **Nothing in the simulation may read an event back.** Events are write-only
  observation; a system that reads one makes the observer part of the observed.
- **New state must be reachable from `WorldState`** or it is invisible to the
  hash and the snapshot — and therefore silently non-deterministic. When you add
  a field, add it to `HashInto` *and* to `WorldSnapshot` (bump its
  `FormatVersion`) in the same commit.
- **A gameplay rule keyed on a terrain id is a rule about the reference
  install, not about DK2.** Ask the terrain's flags. `TileWorkRules` does this
  throughout and `TileWorkOnRealDataTests` checks it still holds against the
  real database.
- **A number that does not match how the original plays is not licence to
  change it.** Reproduce the data, record the discrepancy as an open question,
  and let the scenario output show it (Q20 is the live example).
- **A decimal printed from an `Fp32` is lossy.** Transcribe the raw value.
  `dk2tools kwd creature <name>` prints a `raw:` line for exactly this reason;
  the fixture's first copy of the Imp's hunger rate was 32767 where the raw
  value is 134213632, and only the real-data guard caught it.
- **Read a creature's capability from its flags, never its id.** `IsWorker`
  picks out the Imp and the Dwarf; `CanWalkOnWater` / `CanWalkOnLava` decide
  what a mover may cross. Same rule as terrain flags, same reason.
- Confidence tags are mandatory in docs and code comments:
  **CONFIRMED / STRONGLY INFERRED / HYPOTHESIS / UNKNOWN**.
- Every researched mechanic gets a `docs/research/<name>.md` using the template
  in `DK2_REIMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Appendix B.
- Never commit anything from `original-reference/` or any `.kwd`/`.wad`/`.kmf`
  (gitignored, but check before `git add -A`; a third-party template slipped in
  once and had to be removed in `4cdcd38`).

---

## Environment gotchas (each of these already cost time)

**Bash heredocs and C#.** Writing C# via `cat > file <<'EOF'` has bitten twice
by eating backslashes (`Replace('\\', '/')` → `Replace('\', '/')`), and once by
choking on a file containing backticks. Use the `Write`/`Edit` tools for any C#
containing backslash escapes or backticks; verify with `grep` otherwise.

**`cat > file` with no stdin hangs** the Bash tool until timeout. So does
`python`/`python3` — it is not installed and the Windows Store stub blocks.
Never write a bare `cat >` redirect, and do not reach for python.

**`ctx_batch_execute` sandbox quirks:**
- `for ... do ... done` loops fail to parse (the wrapper prefixes the command
  on one line). Use separate commands or `;`-chained statements.
- `/tmp` does not persist between commands in a batch — each gets a fresh
  workspace. Pipe directly, or `curl -o` and use the file in the *same* command.
- `python3` is not available; `curl`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `perl`, `xxd` are.

**`dotnet build` takes one project, not several.** Pass `DK2.slnx` instead.

**Windows/git:** CRLF warnings on every commit are expected noise.

## Research method that has been working

Cheap-to-expensive, stop as soon as the question is answered:

0. **Ask the owner, or hand them `docs/research/observation-checklist.md`.**
   They have played DK2 and the original is the behavioural oracle. That file
   lists every open question a person in front of the game can settle by
   looking, as concrete experiments, and says which ones playing cannot settle.

   This is the cheapest source there is and it was under-used: Q37 (the mana
   ceiling) and the one-dungeon-heart rule were both settled in one sentence
   after being written up as unanswerable from the files. A question of the form
   "what does the player *see* happen" is almost always one of these. Record the
   answer as CONFIRMED with "owner observation" as the evidence, the same way a
   data extract is recorded — and record a "no" too, since it closes a question
   just as hard.
1. Is the answer just sitting in the KWD data? (Often yes — check first.)
2. ufdada/dk2-tools 010 Editor templates — independent format facts.
3. Flame's `mapping/DKII_EXE_v170.sgmap` — 868 structs, 10,548 globals.
4. OpenKeeper — consult as documentation only (GPLv3).
5. Only then: IDA/Ghidra on DKII.EXE, using Flame's IDA import scripts.

**Validate offsets structurally, never on trust.** The techniques that have
caught real errors so far:
- Record size must equal `contentSize / itemCount` exactly (caught the 40-byte
  WAD entry stride, which the template got wrong at 36).
- Sum the template's field widths and check it reproduces the record size
  (confirmed terrain 552 and rooms 1055 before writing any parser).
- Look for semantic invariants: happy-job chances summing to 100 across all 46
  creatures proved the JobPreference offsets were right.
- Cross-check between independent parsers: room→terrain→creature references all
  resolving is strong evidence all three are correct.
- Sanity-check values against known DK2 behaviour (Vampire 666 damage, Prison
  spawning Skeletons, Hero Lair healing).

## Live research questions

`docs/research/open-questions.md` holds all 51, of which **23 were answered on
2026-08-29 by the owner**; most are recorded rather than built, and one of them
(Q31) has since been built. The ones that gate progress:

- **Q47 — every tile-work rate here is about twice as fast as the original.**
  The largest live question in the tile mechanics, and the one most likely to be
  misread by a future session: the *rate* looks right and the *granularity* does
  not. Needs exact hit counts, not ranges. Supersedes the old framing of Q20,
  which treated `DigRockHealth` as one odd number — it is now the sole outlier
  in a model that otherwise fits.
- **Q40 — losing your dungeon heart is defeat.** Now fully described (the
  defeated keeper's creatures leave by the nearest portal; rivals claim their
  rooms and gold) and **not implementable yet**: it needs portals, which are an
  M6 record. Scheduled with objectives and win conditions.
- **Q7 — the creature mood model.** No longer a blank sheet. The four things that
  anger a creature are recorded and three of them map onto fields already parsed
  per creature (`AngerNoLair`, `AngerNoFood`, `AngerNoPay`). What is missing is
  the shape — accumulation, decay, thresholds. This was the area nobody had
  solved; it is now the area with a starting point.
- **Q1 — simulation tick rate.** Blocking any timing claim. Flame's `limit_tps`
- **Q1 — simulation tick rate.** Blocking any timing claim. Flame's `limit_tps`
  patch proves it is fixed; the value is unmeasured. It is one constant,
  `SimulationTiming.TicksPerSecond`, and it must stay that way. **Do not go
  looking in the KWD data again**: id 74 `GameTicks` exists in the format's id
  space but no shipped file carries it — checked across every editor KWD and all
  71 map KWDs. Q1 needs measurement against the running original.
- **Q19 — what the health deltas are *per*.** Tied to Q1. The variables table
  spells out `…PerSecond` / `…Seconds` on its other entries and not on these
  ten, which is the whole of the ambiguity.
- **Q20 — `DigRockHealth` is −5000 against Rock's 165 health.** One application
  destroys it, so digging earth is instantaneous, which is wrong. Every other
  work rate is sane. New at M3 and the first place the data and the original
  visibly disagree. Candidate explanations in `tile-work.md`.
- **Q18 is now answered** (2026-08-29): `maxHealthTypeTerrainId` is the
  destination of whichever upward job the terrain admits. Do not reopen it
  without new evidence.
- **Q5 — pathfinding.** The project's biggest risk (plan §9, R1). Flame names
  `Follow_Path` but has zero named fields for it. Nobody has solved this. Now
  load-bearing rather than theoretical: `GridPathfinder` routes every worker,
  and Q28 (four- or eight-connected?) and Q30 (does terrain weight a path?) are
  the two cheapest pieces of it to settle against the original.
- **Q2 — job selection.** Narrowed: candidates and weights are *data*. The
  remaining unknown is the procedure around them (re-evaluation timing, how
  mood picks which of the three tables applies, handling unavailable jobs).
- **Q7 — creature moods.** Genuinely unsolved; OpenKeeper's system is an empty
  stub after 12 years.
- **New at M2 — system update order.** DK2's own per-tick subsystem ordering is
  UNKNOWN. Ours is explicit and declared in exactly one place
  (`SimulationSystems.Default()`, ADR-0013). It starts to matter around M4;
  treat it as a research question then, not a convenience choice.

## Corrections carried forward

At the end of the previous session I told the owner that `AGENTS.md` references
a `docs/ai/CLAUDE.md` scoping the assistant to research and analysis, and
suggested it might need updating now that implementation has started. **That was
wrong.** No `CLAUDE.md` exists anywhere in the repository and `AGENTS.md` makes
no such reference. There is nothing to reconcile; do not go looking for it.

`AGENTS.md` itself is the operating instruction, and it does not restrict
implementation.
